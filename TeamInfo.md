## Project Summary
Illini BookBridge is an application that allows students at the University of Illinois to not only get information about their favorite books, but to also connect with other students who share the same book interests. 

This application allows users to search for a book and retrieve all kinds of book information such as genre, author, publisher, awards, etc. The social component allows students to connect with others who have the same tastes in books as them. If a user wishes to connect with another user, the student will be provided with the other personâ€™s contact information so they can get connected and possibly form a book community.
