## Project Summary
Illini BookBridge allows students at the University of Illinois to discover their favorite books from a database of books. This application allows users to filter through a database (e.g., by genre, author, rating, publisher) and to retrieve relevant book information.

Additionally, Illini BookBridge has a social component which allows students to connect others who have the same tastes in books as them. The user can then retrieve a list of contact information of students who share the same interests in a specific genre/author of books, they can get connected and form their own book communities, without having to post on social media.
