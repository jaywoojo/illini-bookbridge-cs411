### App Info
Built with Node.js, Express, JS/JQuery. Using a MySQL database hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). CSS/HTML/Bootstrap for front-end. 

### How to run the application
To run the server, (1) add a .env file with our GCP DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASS. (2) npm install (3) npx nodemon server.js (4) open http://localhost:8080/ in browser

Our server currently is running locally because it is easier to work on due to GCP VM SSH lagging issues. For Stage 5 it will also be cloned to be hosted on GCP.
