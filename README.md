To be completed in future stages...

To run server, (1) add a .env file with our GCP DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASS. (2) npm install (3) npx nodemon server.js (4) open http://localhost:8080/ in browser

Our server currently is running locally because it is easier to work on due to GCP VM SSH lagging issues. For Stage 5 it will be hosted on GCP.

Stages:
For Stage 0, created README and filled out information on the TeamInfo document.
For Stage 1, created Project Description.
For Stage 2, created Conceptual and Logical Database Design
For Stage 3, created Database Design.
For Stage 4, created interface for CRUD for Midterm Demo. AND updated Stage 2 to gain back missed points by adding a weak entity for Statistics table.
